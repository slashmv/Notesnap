Alright class, let's condense these notes on "R.A." – which I believe is meant to be **Arrays**, a fundamental concept in data structures. It's excellent you're taking the time to understand these basics!

Here's a summary of what you've learned about Arrays:

### Understanding Arrays: A Core Data Structure

An **Array** is a foundational data structure that serves as a building block for implementing more complex structures like stacks or strings. It has several key characteristics:

1.  **Homogenous**: All elements within an array must be of the same data type (e.g., all integers, all characters). You can't mix different types in one array.
2.  **Linear**: Elements are arranged in a sequential manner, one after another, allowing for a defined order.
3.  **Static**: When you create an array, its entire memory is allocated in a single, continuous block, and its size is fixed from that point onwards. This means the allocated memory cannot be used for other purposes, even if the array isn't entirely filled.

#### Advantages of Using Arrays:

*   **Direct Access (Constant Time Complexity)**: Because elements are stored in a contiguous block and the size is fixed, you can directly access any element using its index. This operation takes constant time (O(1)), making arrays very efficient for retrieving data.

#### Disadvantages of Using Arrays:

*   **Fixed Size Limitations**: If an array is full and you need to add a new element, you must create an entirely new, larger array and then copy all the elements from the old array to the new one. This can be an expensive operation in terms of time and resources.
*   **Wasted Space**: The fixed allocation means that even if an array isn't completely full, the memory allocated for its maximum size is reserved and cannot be used by other parts of your program.
