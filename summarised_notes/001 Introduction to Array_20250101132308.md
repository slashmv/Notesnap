# Summary of Arrays

In this lesson, we will explore the concept of arrays, including their declaration, initialization, and methods for accessing their elements.

## Introduction to Variables

Before diving into arrays, let's first understand simple variables:

- **Variable**: A storage location with a name and a data type.
- **Example**: 
  - Declaring an integer variable: 
    - `int x = 10;`
    - Memory allocation: If an integer requires 2 bytes, variable `x` will use addresses 100 and 101 to store the value 10.
- **Scalar Variable**: A type of variable that holds a single value (e.g., `x` can hold only 10).

## What is an Array?

An array is a data structure that allows you to store multiple values of the same type under a single name. 

### Key Features of Arrays:
- **Collection of Elements**: Arrays can hold a list or set of values (e.g., a list of integers).
- **Type Consistency**: All elements in an array must be of the same data type.

### Declaration of an Array:

- **Syntax Example**: 
  - `int a[5];` - This declares an array named `a` with a size of 5, allowing it to store 5 integers.
- **Memory Allocation**: 
  - If integers take 2 bytes, an array of size 5 will require 10 bytes of memory, allocated contiguously. 
  - Example addresses: 200, 201, 202, 203, 204.

### Accessing Array Elements:

- **Indices**: Each element in the array can be accessed using an index, starting from 0.
  - Example: 
    - To access the first integer: `a[0]`
    - To store 15 in the third position: `a[2] = 15;`
  
### Summary of Key Points:

- **Array vs. Scalar Variable**: 
  - A scalar variable holds a single value (e.g., `x`), while an array (e.g., `a`) can hold multiple values.
- **Memory Organization**: Memory for arrays is allocated in contiguous blocks.
- **Supported Across Languages**: Arrays are a fundamental feature in various programming languages, including C and C++.

In the next section, we will explore different methods to declare and initialize an array.
